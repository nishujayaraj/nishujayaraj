# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Nischitha S Jayaraja, a CS Grad student at San Diego State University.
Lately, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in Data Science and Machine Learning, and Iâ€™m especially fascinated by how deep neural networks can be applied to solve real-world challenges.
I come from a DevOps and Software Development background,now diving deep into Machine Learning, exploring areas like NLP, deep learning, and data-driven problem solving.

Currently learning about Gradients and Activation.
